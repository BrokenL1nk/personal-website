# personal-website
My personal website, built with HTML and CSS. 

No JavaScript was used, and as a result the website is pretty static. It was mostly made for me to get familiar with building something from the ground-up, without the help of frameworks.

I plan to keep adding to this, refining it, making it more responsive etc.
